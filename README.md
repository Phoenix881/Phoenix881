<summary><strong>How I got into software development (reading time ~2min)</strong></summary>

I wrote my first computer program back in 2019, when I was in the middle school. It was a simple calculator app written in C# as I was following some YouTube tutorial on building a game from scratch with Unity. After I learned syntax of C# and tried to run Unity game engine, my laptop crashed. 

And so I switched to learning Python. Knowing basics of Python allowed me to write some simple scripts for convinience and sometimes school projects. My most complicated project at that time was a Telegram bot for chemistry class project. It was hosted through Heroku and could quizz students on how well they understood our presentation and choose the winner.

My journey with proper software development started quite recently, however. It started with taking CS50 near the end of my high school. For the final project I developed a Sudoku solver that used an intuitive algorithm I came up with. Using that approach, my script can solve a regular sudoku puzzle in just a few cycles - comparred to a more traditional back-tracking algorithm that on average requires 15,000 cycles. CS50 course helped to me to put my scattarred knowledge into a clean structure and gave me a solid foundation. 

Next, during the summer after my first year in college I got an internship focused on web coding and working with Large Language Models; that's where I built a full-stack web app to aid in grading data analysis students' Jupyter notebooks. This internship experience exposed me to working on real projects, collaborating closely with collegues through GitHub, and writing clear documentation to present my end results.
