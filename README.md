#### Who am I?
Fast-learning university student...blah-blah-blah - all right, that's on my CV already. Not need for tautology. 

I'm Kieran, a sophomore mathematics students from Hong Kong. My journey with software development started quite recently, at the end of my high school with taking Harvard's CS50. For that course's final project I developed a simple sudoku solver that used a simple and intuitive algorithm I came up with, with it on board my script could solve any logically-solveable sudoku puzzle in a matter of a second. Next, during the summer after my first year in college I got an internship focused on web coding and working with Large Language Models, that's where I built a full-stack web app to aim in grading data analysis students' Jupyter notebooks. 

#### What I kind do?
Programming languages (Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, C/C++), Jupyter Notebooks, Data Visualization, Microsoft Excel, Web Backend (FastAPl, Flask), GitHub, Docker, Llama.cpp, LLM fine-tuning, ML on Python, Virtual machines (UTM, QEMU, VirtualBox), OpenAl API, Analytical Thinking, Logical Thinking, Problem-solving, Communication, Adaptability, Creativity.
