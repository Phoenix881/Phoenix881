#### Who am I?
Hi! I'm Kieran, a sophomore mathematics students from Hong Kong. 

My journey with software development started quite recently, at the end of my high school with taking Harvard's CS50. Next, during the summer after my first year in college I got an internship focused on web coding and working with Large Language Models, that's where I built a full-stack web app to aid in grading data analysis students' Jupyter notebooks. 

I'm interested in Software Engineering, Data Analysis, working with AI, and low-level coding (although the last one is mainly as a hobby).
